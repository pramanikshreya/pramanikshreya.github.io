<p>Circa 2019, when the time spent on commute added grey hair to my 20 something head, I desperately wished for work from home. Only now I realize, work from home is nice. Work from only home is a curse. As work piles on, things that were so simple in a physical office to collaborate on, is a 100 times tougher. Building a team, architecting a platform in a conference room whiteboard. Dream of the past. The recent article on @the-ken about pandemic WFH troubles comes to mind. </p>

<p>While things get harder and the team reaches a stage of burnout, work keeps piling on because clients also have a business to run, and guess what the more than 1 year long pandemic has done? It has made it  insanely hard for them to close deals. And the pressure always comes back to us (the software guys).

<p>As an entrepreneur, and a business owner I have had to draw the line between between burning myself to the ground or taking a step back and staying alive for the longer haul. Nothing comes easy they say. It wasn't easy before and it is harder now.

<p>As entrepreneurs, we don't like restrictions, and we want to keep growing, but turns out this year is a lesson on survival. If you survive, you grow later. I am not talking about the gazillion dollar valuation startups that seems to have zero or -ve revenue. (This only applies to earthly bootstrapped or humbly funded startups, what I call normal startups)

<p>Anyway, the moral I guess is we will learn how to survive well for future crisis from this extended shit show of waves and lockdowns.
