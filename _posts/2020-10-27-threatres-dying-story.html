<p>Theatre and cinema halls across the world are facing an interesting dilemma of survival. People are betting one against the other. Most say streaming will kill the physical standalone theatres, some larger ones might survive.</p>

<p>I have a slightly different opinion. The convenience of streaming services are because of one-stop content delivery platform. The allure of a cinema hall or theatres is the experience, the immersive social sense of belonging somewhere where you enjoy the story along with other loved and stranger ones.

<p>"The book talks about Morrie a professor of sociology at Brandeis University. He loves to dance and make merry until he finds out that he is dying from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Morrie is shaken up by the news, yet, he manages to come to terms with his illness.</p>

<p>I think this demarcation is important, one that will ensure survival of both in the age of uncertainity. What if the content delivery networks itself licensed that with some subscription for special category ie. theatres to play the same in halls. Imagine as a consumer, you can walk into a theatre and watch a re-run of FRIENDS.
