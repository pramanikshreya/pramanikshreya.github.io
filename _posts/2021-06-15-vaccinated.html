<p>Vaccination a story of how and when we get to defeat the virus, but with a subtle note of grief and the weight of the loss that lead to this.

<p>It is a marvelous feat of science, that within a year into the pandemic I received my first shot. Living in an incredible time. It started with butterflies and anxiety before the vaccination interspersed with excitement.

<p>When I finally received it, suddenly hit me with the missing faces that no longer dwell on this planet. And I wonder did they ever get to know that we are fighting this despite the loss that happened and will probably happen. The invisible enemy and the invisible solution.

<p>So yeah, the mixed emotions are essentially what it boils down to. The cost of this tragedy born by humanity and how this species survives that, laughs and even thrives on the face of biggest humanitarian crisis witnessed at-least for our younger population. It is a lesson in resilience, patience and healing.
